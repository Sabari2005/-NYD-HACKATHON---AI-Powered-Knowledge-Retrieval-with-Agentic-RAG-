    "Translation": "The movement of the inhalation and exhalation can be stopped",
    "answer": "According to Patanjali Yoga Sutra, the mental distractions can be calmed through the practice of breath control. In verse 1.34, it is stated that by regulating the flow of inhalation and exhalation, the disturbances of the mind can be stopped. This is achieved through the practice of slowing down the breath, which in turn slows down the fluctuation of the mind, thereby leading to a state of calmness. Additionally, pausing after forceful exhalations, experiencing thoughts that are luminous and free of sorrow, and steadily observing new sensations can also aid in achieving stillness of mind. Furthermore, retaining the breath after inhalation or exhalation, as mentioned in verse 2.50, helps to still the mind and brings about a state of tranquility. The Bhagavad Gita also supports these methods, explaining the process of offering the exhalation into the inhalation in chapter 4, verse 29, which helps to calm the mind through controlled breathing."

    "Sanskrit": "श्रीभगवानुवाच | इमं विवस्वते योगं प्रोक्तवान्हम् अव्ययम् | ब्रह्मा चाप्यायं श्रुत्वा मयात्मभावे गुरौ |",
    "Translation": "The Lord said: I taught this imperishable yoga to Vivasvat; Vivasvat taught it to Manu; and Manu taught it to Ikshvaku.",
    "Answer": "According to the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna is considered the primordial teacher or original master, as He claims to have taught the sun god Vivasvat, who then taught Manu, and it was passed down through a lineage of teachers. In the Patanjali Yoga Sutra, the concept of Isvara is referenced as an omniscient sage, often interpreted as Lord or a special being, emphasizing the role of a primordial teacher in spiritual guidance and Self-realization. Isvara is revered as the original master, guiding individuals towards the attainment of Self-realization, and is considered the ultimate reality as described in these texts."

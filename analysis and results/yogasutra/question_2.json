    "answer": "The purpose of Yoga, as defined by Patanjali, is to attain a state where the modifications of the mind (vrittis) are restrained or stilled (nirodha). This means that the ultimate goal of Yoga is to quiet the fluctuations of the mind, achieving a state of inner peace, calmness, and tranquility. By achieving this state, the practitioner can experience a deeper sense of awareness, connection to their true nature, and liberation from the cycles of suffering. In essence, the purpose of Yoga is to unite the individual self (jiva) with the universal self (brahman), leading to a state of supreme consciousness and Self-realization."

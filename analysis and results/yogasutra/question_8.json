    "sanskrit": "tad-vat-kāmayamānaḥ lokas-tad-vat-kāmayate tvām, aprayānti ca ye te dhīrāḥ; saṅgaṁ tyaktvā phalāni ca kartin̄nam, akarmā karma yaḥ paśyati sa buddhimān, sa samyasse yuktaḥ kr̥tsna-kr̥tsnaṁ karmaṇy akarman san; yathā dīpo nivāta-stho neṅgate sopamā smṛtā, yogino yat-acittasya yuñjato yogam-ātta-cittasya",
    "Translation": "The world is driven by desires, and people are driven by their desires, but those who are wise and self-controlled are not swayed by them; One who has renounced attachment to the fruits of their actions and has dedicated themselves to the pursuit of self-realization, is able to see the world in a detached manner, without being driven by personal desires or motivations; The yogi who has controlled the mind and is united with the self, is like a lamp in a windless place, which does not flicker",
    "answer": "Dispassion (vairāgya) is a fundamental concept in the Bhagavad Gita and Patanjali Yoga Sutra, which refers to the state of being free from attachment and desire. The signs of successful dispassion include the ability to remain calm and composed in challenging circumstances, and to maintain a sense of inner peace and detachment in all situations. A person who has attained dispassion is able to see the world in a clear and unbiased manner, without being driven by personal desires or attachments."

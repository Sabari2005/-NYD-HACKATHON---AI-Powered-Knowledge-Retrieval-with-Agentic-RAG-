    "answer": "The Patanjali Yoga Sutra provides a technique to calm the mind using the senses, known as Pratyahara. Pratyahara is the fifth limb of yoga, and it involves the withdrawal of the senses from their external objects. This means that instead of allowing the senses to run wildly after external stimuli, one learns to control them and direct them inward. By recognizing the constant flow of sensory impressions and the mind's reaction to them, one can begin to detach from these impressions and withdraw the senses. To practice Pratyahara, one can start by sitting in a quiet and comfortable position, closing the eyes, and bringing awareness to each sense organ. Begin with the eyes, noticing any sensations or thoughts that arise. Gradually, bring awareness to the ears, nose, tongue, and skin, observing any sensations or impulses without reacting to them. As one practices Pratyahara, the mind begins to calm down, and the senses become less reactive. This allows for a deeper state of inner awareness and calmness to emerge. The practice of Pratyahara prepares the mind for higher states of meditation and self-awareness, ultimately leading to a greater sense of peace and inner tranquility."

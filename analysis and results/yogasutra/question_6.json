    "answer": "According to the Patanjali Yoga Sutra, the state of mind in sleep is defined as a mental modification known as 'nidrā'. In verse 1.6, 'nidrā' is listed as one of the five types of mental modifications (vṛttis) that occur in the mind, along with correct knowledge (pramaṇa), misconception (viparyaya), fantasy (vikalpa), and memory (smṛti). The Yoga Sutra describes sleep as a state where the mind is withdrawn from its normal functioning and becomes unconscious, and this state is considered a modification of the mind. Therefore, according to the Patanjali Yoga Sutra, sleep is indeed a mental modification. Recognizing sleep as a mental modification is essential to understand the workings of the mind and to attain a higher state of consciousness, where one can observe the mind and its modifications, including sleep, without being bound by them."

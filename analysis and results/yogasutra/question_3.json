    "Book_name": "Patanjali Yoga Sutra",
    "chapter": "1",
    "verse": "2",
    "sanskrit": "योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः",
    "Translation": "The purpose of yoga is to quieten the fluctuations of the chitta (mind).",
    "answer": "The end result of Yoga practice, as described in the Patanjali Yoga Sutra and the Bhagavad Gita, is the attainment of complete liberation, self-realization, and union with the Divine, characterized by the realization of one's true nature as pure consciousness and the absence of all suffering and bondage. This state is achieved through the practice of prasankhyana, or the withdrawal of the senses, and the cessation of the modifications of the mind, ultimately leading to Kaivalya, or the isolation of the Self from the non-Self."

    "Translation": "Other than this, the mind is controlled, and the tranquil state is beyond the reach of the senses.",
    "answer": "The ultimate state of meditative absorption, as described in Patanjali Yoga Sutras, is known as Dharmamegha Samadhi or Nirodha Samadhi, where the mind achieves complete absorption in the object of meditation. This state is characterized by the cessation of all thoughts, desires, and fluctuations of the mind, and the individual experiences a deep sense of inner peace, tranquility, and oneness with the universe. The individual self (Jiva) merges with the universal self (Brahman), and the yogi achieves liberation (Moksha) from the cycle of birth and death. In this state, the individual experiences supreme bliss, consciousness, and freedom. The characteristics of the highest level of samprajnata or asamprajnata samadhi include the complete control over the fluctuations of the mind, and the mind is completely stilled, leading to a profound sense of unity and freedom."

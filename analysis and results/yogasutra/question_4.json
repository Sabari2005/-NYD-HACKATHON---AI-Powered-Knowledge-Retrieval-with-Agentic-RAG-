    "Translation": "Viparyayo mithyājñānam, Wrong cognition or false understanding",
    "answer": "In the context of the Bhagavad Gita and Patanjali Yoga Sutra, wrong knowledge or error is referred to as 'Viparyaya' or 'Mithyājñāna'. Viparyaya is a Sanskrit term that literally means 'wrong cognition' or 'false understanding'. Mithyājñāna means 'false knowledge' or 'erroneous knowledge'. According to Patanjali, wrong knowledge arises when the mind misinterprets or distorts reality, leading to a false understanding of the world. This can occur due to various factors such as ignorance, misconceptions, or a lack of discernment. In the Bhagavad Gita, a similar concept is discussed, where Lord Krishna warns Arjuna about the dangers of wrong knowledge and ignorance. The idea of wrong knowledge and error is an essential theme in both texts, highlighting the importance of acquiring correct knowledge and understanding to achieve spiritual growth and self-realization."

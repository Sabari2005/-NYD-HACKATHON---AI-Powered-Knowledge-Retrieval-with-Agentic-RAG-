    "Translation": "The mind is concentrated and becomes one with the object of meditation, without any distraction or mental modification. This state is known as Nirvitarka Samapatti, where the mind has transcended even the subtlest attachment or support, and has become completely free and unaided.",
    "answer": "In the higher level of meditative absorption, the cognition of a mind appears as a state of complete absorption in the object of meditation, without any distraction or mental modification. According to Patanjali Yoga Sutra, this state is known as Nirvitarka Samapatti. Nirvitarka Samapatti is the state of concentration where the mind is absorbed in the object of meditation without any logical reasoning or verbal deliberation (vitarka). It is a state of pure, wordless, and imageless awareness, where the mind directly experiences the object of meditation without any mental construct or conceptualization. In contrast, Savitarka Samapatti is a state of concentration where the mind is aware of the object of meditation through logical reasoning and verbal deliberation. The key difference between Nirvitarka and Savitarka Samapatti lies in the level of mental modification and the degree of awareness. While Savitarka Samapatti involves a higher level of mental modification and conceptualization, Nirvitarka Samapatti is characterized by a complete transcendence of mental constructs and a direct experience of the object of meditation. The state of Nirvitarka Samapatti is attained when the mind has achieved a high level of concentration, purification, and control over its modifications. It is a state of deep meditation, where the mind has become completely still and tranquil, and is able to directly experience the ultimate reality or the true nature of the object of meditation."

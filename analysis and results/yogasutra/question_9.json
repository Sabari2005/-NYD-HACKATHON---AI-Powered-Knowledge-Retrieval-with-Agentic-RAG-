    "answer": "The attribute of an elevated level of dispassion is described as the ability to gradually let go of or renounce worldly attachments and desires. This elevated level of dispassion is achieved through a resolute and determined intellect. When the highest level of dispassion is reached, the individual detaches from worldly desires and ego, and experiences a state of inner peace, and ultimately achieves self-realization. The individual experiences a state known as 'vairagya' or detachment from the guṇas, which is described as para-vairagya, leading to the realization of the true Self."

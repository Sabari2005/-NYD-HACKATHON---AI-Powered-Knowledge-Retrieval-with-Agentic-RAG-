    "verse": "47-51",
    "sanskrit": "Nirvichāra vā savichāra ananda āsmitānugamāt samprajñātāḥ",
    "Translation": "The states of samprajnata are also of two kinds: with and without Vitarka ( Intellect-based thinking with ideas)",
    "answer": "The mind behaves in a state of calmness and stability once it passes the higher levels of meditation. The special quality bestowed upon it is the state of 'nirvichara' or 'nirbija', where the mind is considered to be at its purest state. However, one can still fall from this state if they are not careful, and hence constant practice and detachment are necessary to maintain this state."

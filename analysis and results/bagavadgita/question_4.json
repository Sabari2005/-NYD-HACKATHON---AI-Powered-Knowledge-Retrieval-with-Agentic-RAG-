    "Translation": "Drupada, the Pandavas' sons (sons of Draupadi), and all the Panchalas, as well as Yudhamanyu, the brave Uttamaujas",
    "answer": "Duryodhana, in the Bhagavad Gita, begins his conversation with Dronacharya by identifying some of the key warriors in the Pandava army. Specifically, he mentions Drupada, who is the father of Draupadi (the wife of the Pandavas) and the commander of the Panchalas; the sons of Draupadi (Draupadeyas); and all the other Panchala warriors. Further, he identifies two notable warriors from the Pandava side: Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas. Yudhamanyu, who is described as 'vikranta' or powerful, and Uttamaujas, who is described as 'viryavan' or full of valor. Both of these warriors were allies of the Pandavas and fought bravely on their side. By mentioning these particular warriors, Duryodhana highlights the strengths of the Pandava army and, in doing so, displays his recognition of the formidable challenge that lies ahead for the Kauravas."

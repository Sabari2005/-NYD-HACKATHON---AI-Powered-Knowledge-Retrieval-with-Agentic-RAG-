    "Book_name": "Bhagavad Gita",
    "chapter": 1,
    "verse": 21,
    "sanskrit": "हृषीकेशं तदा वाक्यमिदमाह महीपते| सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये रथं स्थापय मेऽच्युत  || 1.21 ||",
    "Translation": "Arjuna said, 'O Krishna, place my chariot in the middle between the two armies, so that I may behold those who stand here, desirous to fight, and know with whom I must fight when the battle is about to commence.'",
    "answer": "Arjuna asked Krishna to station his chariot between the two armies, so he could see those who were assembled to fight against him. He wanted to see the people he was about to engage in battle with, and get a sense of the opposing forces. Specifically, Arjuna requested Krishna to position the chariot in a way that he could survey the warriors gathered on both sides, particularly the grandfathers, teachers, and other close relatives who were now part of the enemy forces. This request indicates Arjuna's apprehension about the war and his reluctance to engage in battle against his own kin."

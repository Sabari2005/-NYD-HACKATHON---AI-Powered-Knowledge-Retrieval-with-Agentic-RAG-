    "Book_name": "Bhagavad Gita",
    "chapter": 1,
    "verse": 1,
    "sanskrit": "धृतराष्ट्र उवाच धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युङ्यवः मामाके पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय",
    "Translation": "Dhritarashtra said, 'What did my people and the sons of Pandu do when they had assembled together, eager for battle, on the holy plain of Kurukshetra, O Sanjaya?'",
    "answer": "The Bhagavad Gita starts with the statement of Dhritarashtra, the blind king, where he inquires about the gathering of his sons (the Kauravas) and the Pandavas on the holy field of Kurukshetra, which is also known as the field of dharma. Dhritarashtra is concerned about the impending battle and asks Sanjaya, his charioteer and advisor, to tell him what his sons and the Pandavas are doing on the field, indicating the beginning of the narrative of the epic battle of the Mahabharata, within which the Bhagavad Gita is set. This verse sets the stage for the dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna that follows, exploring the nature of duty, action, and spiritual growth."

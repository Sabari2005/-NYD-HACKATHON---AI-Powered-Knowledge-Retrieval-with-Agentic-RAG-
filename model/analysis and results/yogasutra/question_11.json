    "sanskrit": "ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्| मम वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थ सर्वशः || 4.11 ||",
    "Translation": "In whatever way men approach Me, even so do I reward them; My path do men tread in all ways, O Arjuna.",
    "answer": "The Bhagavad Gita elucidates three primary paths (margas) for achieving self-realization or moksha (liberation), which cater to different human natures and temperaments. These are: Karma Yoga (Path of Action), Jnana Yoga (Path of Knowledge), and Bhakti Yoga (Path of Devotion). Patanjali's Yoga Sutras also describe a path, often referred to as Raja Yoga (Royal Yoga) or Ashtanga Yoga (Eight-Limbed Yoga), which is a systematic approach to realizing the ultimate reality through the practice of Yamas, Niyamas, Asanas, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi. These paths are not mutually exclusive, and most spiritual journeys will incorporate aspects from multiple margas. The choice of path depends on an individual's nature, tendencies, and the level of their spiritual development. Ultimately, the goal of all these paths is the same: to free the individual from the cycle of suffering and rebirth (samsara), achieving blissful union with the divine, or self-realization."

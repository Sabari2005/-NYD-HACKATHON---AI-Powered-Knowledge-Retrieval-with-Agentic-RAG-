    "answer": "To calm mental distractions and cultivate emotional intelligence, one can practice the virtues of friendliness, compassion, delight, and equanimity towards all beings, as described in the Patanjali Yoga Sutra.

The concept of citta-prasādanam, or calming of the mind through peacefulness, allows the adept to practice acceptance and friendliness. By cultivating self-awareness, will, and virtuous qualities, one can progress towards balance and detachment, fostering better mental health and achieving a state of luminous thought free of sorrow."

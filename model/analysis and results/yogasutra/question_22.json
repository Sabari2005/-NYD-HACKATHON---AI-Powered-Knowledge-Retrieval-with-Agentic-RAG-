    "Translation": "Complete absorption in any object, whether subtlest and (macroscopic or) microscopic, is possible through meditation.",
    "answer": "The ability gained by those who have controlled their mental distractions is the gain of mastery over higher states of consciousness, distinct siddhis, and higher perceptive awareness, allowing individuals access to higher levels of knowledge and awareness. With such mastery, an individual can then attain higher levels of awareness and gain distinct powers, allowing them to access higher states of being. The powers that accrue when one calms down their mind include the ability to focus, concentration, and the attainment of higher states of consciousness, distinct siddhis, and higher perceptive awareness. This mastery and ability are described in detail across Patanjali Yoga Sutra, especially in Chapter 3, where it is explained that controlling mental distractions leads to the gain of distinct mastery and higher perceptive sense awareness, allowing individuals to access higher levels of knowledge and awareness."

    "Translation": "The impressions/ideas generated by this special knowledge, hinder the activation of other impressions.",
    "answer": "In the Patanjali Yoga Sutra, the nirvichara state refers to a higher stage of concentration (samadhi) where the mind is completely absorbed in the object of meditation, and the distinction between the knower, knowing, and the known is transcended. According to the Patanjali Yoga Sutra (1.43), in the nirvichara state, the mind is so absorbed in the object of meditation that it shines with the mere appearance of the object, as if it were empty of its own form. However, even after reaching the nirvichara state, other impressions (vasanas or samskaras) can still arise due to the stored impressions from past experiences, which are stored in the subconscious mind. These impressions can resurface when the conditions are favorable. The impressions generated by this special knowledge hinder the activation of other impressions, and when these impressions too come to an end, and the movement of consciousness is entirely pacified, this stage of 'impressionless' consciousness is termed as 'seedless' meditative absorption. The elimination of these stored impressions is considered essential for the attainment of the highest state of liberation, known as kaivalya. Therefore, even after reaching the nirvichara state, the practitioner must continue to cultivate self-awareness, detachment, and discriminative knowledge to completely eliminate the stored impressions and attain the ultimate state of liberation."

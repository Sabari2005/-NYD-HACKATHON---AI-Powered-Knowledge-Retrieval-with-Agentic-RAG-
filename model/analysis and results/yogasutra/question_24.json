    "Translation": "Similarly, the states of 'savichara' and 'nirvichara' have objects of contemplation which are subtle in nature.",
    "answer": "The subject matters of the mind at higher levels of meditative absorption, specifically in relation to savichara and nirvichara states, as described in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, involve a deepening focus on subtle objects of contemplation. The savichara state is characterized by a high level of concentration where the mind analyzes and understands the nature of objects with the aid of words, reasoning, and reflection. Beyond savichara, the nirvichara state represents an even deeper level of meditation where the mind transcends the need for thought, reasoning, or reflection, directly perceiving the object and leading to a profound understanding beyond intellectual comprehension. These states relate to the cultivation of a transparent mode of perception, such as samapatti, where the fluctuations of the mind fade away, and the mind reflects everything in its purview equally, like a prism reflecting the constituents of light in seven colors."

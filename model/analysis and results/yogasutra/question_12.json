    "Translation": "Yoga is the cessation of the modifications of the mind, The practice becomes firm and steady, Austerity, self-study, and surrender to a higher power are the components of Kriya Yoga, The eight components of Yoga are the restraints, observances, postures, breath control, withdrawal of the senses, concentration, meditation, and absorption",
    "answer": "The Patanjali Yoga Sutra describes the various levels or aspects of Yoga practice. The practice of Yoga is said to have three main levels or stages of practice - the five external restraints (yamas), five internal observances (niyamas), and the rest which includes postures (asana), breath control (pranayama), withdrawal of the senses (pratyahara), concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana), and absorption (samadhi). These eight components form the Eight-Limbed Yoga. Additionally, the concept of the 'stages of practice' or levels of development in Yoga are described where the practice becomes more firm and steady (tad dridh bhoomi) as one progresses on the path. The proximity to realization varies according to whether the practice is mild, moderate, or intense, and obstacles such as sickness, apathy, doubt, carelessness, laziness, hedonism, delusion, lack of progress, and inconstancy serve as distractions that cloud consciousness and act as barriers. The practice of Yoga helps to overcome these obstacles and achieve realization, and one endowed with wisdom and evenness of mind casts off in this life both good and evil deeds."

    "answer": "The collective term for the higher levels of meditative absorption in Patanjali Yoga Sutra is referred to as 'Sabija Samadhi'. It is further divided into four stages: Savitarka Samadhi, Savichara Samadhi, Sananda Samadhi, and Sasmita Samadhi. These stages represent the four levels of higher consciousness, where the mind is free from desires and distractions, and is focused on a single point, resulting in a state of higher consciousness. The ultimate goal of Yoga is to go beyond these stages and reach 'Nirbija Samadhi', leading to 'Moksha' or liberation."

    "Book_name": "Bhagavad Gita",
    "chapter": "8",
    "verse": "12-13",
    "sanskrit": "भक्त्या त्वनन्यया शक्यं अहम्, न दृश्यात्, न श्रुत्यात्, न तपसा, यतत् दैवद् यद् विभूति, अनन्य वासुदेवो यज्, अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जना: पर्युपासते, तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम्",
    "Translation": "I can be attained by those who devote themselves to me alone, not by sight, nor by hearing, nor by austerity, nor by divine grace, nor by worldly possessions. Those who contemplate on me alone, I take care of their spiritual progress and well-being.",
    "answer": "To take the name of God effectively, one must do so with devotion (bhaktya) and without any other thought or attachment (ananyaya). In the mentioned verses, Lord Krishna emphasizes that God can only be reached through pure devotion and constant contemplation on Him, not through mere sight, hearing, or even rigorous austerities (tapa). By meditating on Him with unwavering dedication (ananyashchintayanto), one should entrust their spiritual upliftment and worldly well-being to the divine will, cultivating a deep sense of devotion and dependence on a higher power for spiritual growth."

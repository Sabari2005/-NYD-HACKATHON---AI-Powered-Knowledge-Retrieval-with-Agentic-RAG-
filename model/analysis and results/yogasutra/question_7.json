    "Translation": "Memory is the retention of objects (experienced) by the mind.",
    "answer": "According to Patanjali Yoga Sutra, memory (smriti) is defined as the retention or recollection of objects, experiences, or knowledge that have been previously perceived or experienced by the mind. It is the ability of the mind to recall and retain past experiences, impressions, and knowledge. This definition highlights the role of memory in storing and retrieving information, which is an essential aspect of the mind's functioning. The concept of memory in the Patanjali Yoga Sutra is closely related to the concept of 'samskara,' which refers to the subconscious impressions or residues of past experiences that are stored in the mind. These samskaras can influence our thoughts, emotions, and actions, often unconsciously, and can be seen as a form of memory that operates below the surface of conscious awareness."

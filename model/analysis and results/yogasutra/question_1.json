The first verse, 'atha yogānuśāsanam,' translates to 'now, the exposition of Yoga.' This implies that the teaching of Yoga begins with the instruction of a guru or a qualified teacher. Therefore, one should start doing Yoga when they have found a competent teacher who can guide them in their practice. This teacher should have a deep understanding of the subject and be able to provide personalized guidance. The initiation of Yoga practice is not solely dependent on the student's readiness but also on the availability of a qualified teacher to instruct them. Hence, the answer to when one should start doing Yoga is when they have found a suitable teacher who can provide proper guidance and instruction."

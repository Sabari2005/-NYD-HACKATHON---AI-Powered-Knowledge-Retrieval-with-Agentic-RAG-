    "answer": "According to Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, taking the name of God, specifically Ishvara, has numerous benefits and outcomes. As described in Chapter 1, verse 29, focusing on Ishvara can lead to the ascension of one's consciousness and the dissipation of obstacles. The correct method of uttering God's name, as mentioned in verse 28, is to repeat it with devotion along with its meaning. Ishvara is symbolized by the sacred sound of 'Om' as stated in verse 27. By chanting God's name in the prescribed manner, one can attain spiritual growth, self-realization, and ultimately, liberation."

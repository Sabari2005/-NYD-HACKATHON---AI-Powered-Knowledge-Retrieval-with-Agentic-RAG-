    "Translation": "Once the stage of nirvichara is comprehended, the nature of the self is illuminated.",
    "answer": "When one successfully goes past the higher levels of meditative absorption, they achieve the state of nirvichara, which is a stage of samadhi where the mind is completely free from all thoughts, reflections, and contemplations. In this state, the mind is no longer bound by the fluctuations of the intellect and the ego, and it experiences a profound sense of inner peace, joy, and freedom. The state of nirvichara is considered to be a significant milestone in the spiritual journey, as it marks the transition from the lower stages of meditation to the higher stages, which are characterized by the absence of all mental modifications. In this state, the practitioner experiences a profound sense of inner peace, joy, and freedom, which is not dependent on any external circumstances or objects."

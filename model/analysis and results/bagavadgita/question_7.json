    "Book_name": "Bhagavad Gita",
    "chapter": 1,
    "verse": 7,
    "sanskrit": "अस्माकं तु विशिष्टा ये तान्निबोध द्विजोत्तम| नायका मम सैन्यस्य संज्ञार्थं तान्ब्रवीमि ते",
    "Translation": "Know also, O best among the twice-born! the names of those who are the most distinguished amongst ourselves, the leaders of my army; these I name to you for your information.",
    "answer": "At the start of the Mahabharata war, Duryodhana approached his guru, Dronacharya, and took the names of all the warriors on both sides to express his confidence and show the strength of his army. However, the Bhagavad Gita begins with this interaction where Duryodhana is letting his preceptor, Dronacharya, know about the arrangement and preparedness of the army, specifically pointing out the positions of notable warriors like Drupada, Virata, and others. By doing this, he aims to convey his confidence in his army and perhaps show a bit of arrogance. However, the deeper meaning in this context is not merely naming but understanding the gravity of the situation they are all about to face, setting the stage for the spiritual discourse that follows in the Bhagavad Gita."
